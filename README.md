## How to write a README.md
A **README.md** should tackle these aspects:

* What is the project about? What does this do?
* How does it work? (Does it operate continuously, or at specific hours?)
* Any additional documentation?
* Any guideline to set it from staging to production?
* What are the dependencies and environment requirements? Badges are welcome:
