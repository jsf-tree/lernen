# GIS - Geographic Information System

OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) is an international consortium of companies, government agencies, research organizations, and universities working together to develop and promote open standards for geospatial data and services.

OGC standards are designed to facilitate interoperability and seamless integration of geospatial technologies, allowing different systems and applications to exchange and use geospatial data effectively. These standards cover a wide range of topics, including data formats, web services, metadata, coordinate reference systems, and more.

OGC standard formats:
|Format|Description|
|---|---|
|Web Map Service (WMS)| Serves maps as images; allows clients to request map images from a server based on spatial extent, layers, and other parameters.|
|Web Feature Service (WFS)| Serves vector feature data; allows clients to query, retrieve, and edit feature data stored in a geospatial database.|
|Web Coverage Service (WCS)| Serves raster data (e.g., satellite imagery, elevation data); allows clients to access and retrieve raster data in its raw form.|
|Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)| Publishing and querying metadata catalogs; allows clients to search for and discover geospatial datasets and services based on various criteria.|
|Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)| A suite of standards for managing and accessing sensor data over the web; enable interoperable sensor networks and facilitate the integration of sensor data into geospatial applications and systems.|

ArcGIS Server standard formats:
|Format|Description|
|---|---|
|Map Service| Map services allow you to share maps, layers, and symbology over the web. They provide access to dynamic or cached maps that can be displayed in web applications or GIS clients.|
|Feature Service| Feature services allow you to share feature data (e.g., points, lines, polygons) over the web. They provide capabilities for querying, editing, and analyzing feature data in real-time.|
|Image Service| Image services allow you to share raster and imagery data over the web. They provide access to imagery collections, aerial photographs, satellite images, and other types of raster data.|
|Geoprocessing Service| Geoprocessing services allow you to run geoprocessing tasks (e.g., buffer, clip, spatial analysis) over the web. They provide access to geoprocessing tools and workflows that can be executed remotely.|
|Geocoding Service| Geocoding services allow you to perform address matching and location-based queries over the web. They provide capabilities for geocoding addresses, reverse geocoding coordinates, and finding places based on search criteria.|
